First of all I want to clarify that this add-on is not finished. Bugs need to be fixed and a virtual cabin needs to be added and textures improved, etc. But I wanted to publish it to have one more add-on available (especially for Linux).

How to install:
Simply drag the contents (that is, the Config, Images, Meshes, Modules, Scenarios, Orbitersdk and Textures folders) from the folder that corresponds to your operating system to the main Orbiter folder.

How to stow/deploy the wings:
if the wings are deployed press the key 1, wait to movement to complete, press key 2, wait, and finally press key 3. Do the same in reverse order (3-2-1) to deploy the wings. Also you can turn on/off the headlights by pressing F and the beacons by pressing B.

How to take off:
The first thing is obviously to accelerate, and once you hear the call "100 knots" start the rotation/pitch up maneuver immediately.

I warn you that it is a little difficult to fly since it was difficult for me to program the flight controls and I am not very good at programming.

Anyway, if you liked it, you can leave me a comment in the Orbiter Forum.
